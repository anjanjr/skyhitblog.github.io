<p>The competition will be conducted via elimination round wherein any two opponents will be selected through random selection.</p></p>
<p>Arena will be unveiled just before the event. (May be of diameter more than 3 meter)</p>
<h3>Team Size</h3>

<li>Robo should fit into a box of 35CMx35CMx35CM (maximum).</li>
<li>Maximum weight of robot should not exceed than 12 kg. (Tolerance +/- 0.5 kg).</li>
<li>The external device used to control the machine or any External device (such as batteries, remotes) is not included in the size constraint.</li>
<li>The machine should be controlled by a wireless remote control Mechanism or wired one throughout the war.</li>
<li>In case of wireless system, it should have a minimum four Frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits or A transmitter-receiver paired module so that the frequency Interferences with opponent team can be avoided (in case of any interference in the wireless systems, they will not be considered for rematch or in the results).</li>
<li>Remote controls that are readily available in the market may also be used.</li>
<li>The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any readymade Kit, if we find such machine it will be disqualified.</li>
<li>If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the Machine should be stacked as single unit.</li>
<li>The Wires should be properly insulated.</li>
<li>It is necessary for all that teams that the bot must be electrically or electronically powered if any team uses any type of mechanical Powered system like IC ENGINE or other then it will be disqualified.</li>
</ol>
<h3>BATTERIES & POWER</h3>
<p>Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte types (gel cells, lithium, NiCad, or dry cells).</p>
<p>The electric voltage anywhere in the machine should not be more than 24V DC at any point of time. On board power supply of 24V DC will be provided. The teams can also use their own power supply.</p>
<h3>GAME RULES</h3>

<li>Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.</li>
<li>Bots immobilized for 10 seconds will result in reduction of points.</li>
<li>If any machine remains immobilize for1 minute it will treated passive and opponent will win the match.</li>
<li>In case of both teams immobilize for1 minute both team will be disqualify.</li>
<li>One or two operators will operate machine in the event.</li>
<li>Damage to arena is not allowed and will lead to disqualification of team.</li>

<li>Violation of any the above rules will lead to disqualification.</li>
<li>Judges' decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Judging Criteria:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized or out of the arena.</li>
<li>A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a timed period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.</li>
<li>If both robots survive the five minutes at that point, the robot with the higher hit points wins.</li>
<li>The winner moves on, the loser is eliminated from the tournament.</li>
</ol>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>Co-ordination Committee reserves the right to add or update rules.</p>
<p>Qualification of a robot to next level be subjective and totally depend upon the decision of the judges. A robot winning in a round against its opponent doesnâ€™t guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges found the winner robot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the robots of a match from advancing to the next round.</p>
