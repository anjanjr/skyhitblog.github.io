<h2>1. Circuit Debugging</h2>

<p>Tentative time limit:</p>
​<p>​Prelims: 30 min</p>
​​<p>Mains: 1 hr</p>
<h3>General rules (tentative):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Group of maximum 3 members.<li>
<li>Preliminary round will consist of objective Q/A. Negative marking for wrong answer.</li>
<li>No calculators are allowed. Extra sheets for rough work shall be provided.</li>
<li>10 groups (max) will be selected to the mains round.</li>
<li>Mains round will constitute debugging a circuit which has some erroneous connections. Participants will be given a time limit inside which they have to identify the errors and make necessary corrections to the circuit.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Labyrinth</h2>

<p>Tentative time limit:</p>
​​<p>Prelims: 1 hr</p>
​​<p>Mains: 1hr 30 min</p>
<h3>General Rules (tentative):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Group of max 3 members.
<li>In prelims, participants will be asked to design a simple circuit, e.g., a full wave bridge rectifier.</li>
<li>10 groups (max) will be selected for the mains round.</li>
<li>If more than 10 groups execute the circuit, speed of execution will be taken into consideration.</li>
<li>In mains, a set of components will be given. Participants will have to use their creativity and design a circuit.</li>
</ol>
