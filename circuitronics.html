<h2>1. Circuit Debugging</h2>
<p>Objective: To debug erroneous circuits within a given time limit</p>

<p>No. of Participants: 2-3 members in a team</p>
<h4>Registration fees: ₹25 each member</h4>

<h4>Rules: ​</h4>
​<ol>
<li>There will be two rounds : a preliminary round of 30 mins and the final round (mains) of 1 hour 30 mins.
</li>
<li>Preliminary round will consist of objective Q/A with negative marking for wrong answers.
</li>
<li>No calculators are allowed. Extra sheets for rough work will be provided.
</li>
<li>10 groups (max) will be selected for the final round.
</li>
<li>Mains will constitute debugging a circuit which has some erroneous connections.
</li>
<li>Participants will be given a time limit within which they have to identify the errors and make necessary corrections to the circuit.
</li></ol>

<h4>Judging Criteria:</h4>
<p>Winner shall be declared on the basis of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Desired output of the circuit is obtained.
</li>
<li>Correct identification of error and explanation of the changes made to rectify them.
</li>
<li>Minimum execution time.

<h2>2. Labyrinth</h2>
<p>Objective : To design a circuit with a given set of components</p>

<p>No. of Participants : 2-3 members in a team</p>

<h4>Registration fees: ₹25 each member</h4>

<h4>Rules:​​​</h4>
<ol>
<li>​There will be two rounds : a preliminary round of 45 mins and the final round (mains) of 2 hours.
</li>
<li>In prelims, participants will be asked to design a simple circuit, e.g., a full wave bridge rectifier.
</li>
<li>10 groups (max) will be selected for the final round.
</li>
<li>If more than 10 groups execute the circuit, a tiebreaker round will be held.
</li>
<li>In mains, a set of components will be given to design any circuit using their creativity.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Judging criteria:</h4>
<p>Winner shall be declared on the basis of:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Explanation of the circuit.</li>
	<li>Practical application of the circuit.</li>
	<li>Simplicity of design.</li>
	<li>Number of components used. (More the better).</li>
</ol>
