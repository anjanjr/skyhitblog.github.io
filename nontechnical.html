<h2>Basic sciences club</h2>
<h3>Extempore speech</h3>
<p>We'll we suppose that most of you know well about it, some of you may have been taking part in this type of event.</p>
<p>Actually in an extempore speech each participant will get one particular topic from the box to be chosen just like in a lucky draw. The topic that the participant will get depends on the paper they choose. The topics will covers almost everything from the science and engineering background, environment issues like pollution, global warming etc, philosophy, etc. We encourage you to be a part of it and there will be a primary and secondary topic for the participants in each sheet to be chosen. However the primary topic will carry more points than the secondary or fifty percent compared to secondary. Each participant will have to choose one sheet which contains the primary and secondary topics from a box.</p>
